        <p>
          Fastest mammal on land, the cheetah can reach speeds of 60 or perhaps
          even 70 miles (97 or 113 kilometers) an hour over short distances. It
          usually chases its prey at only about half that speed, however. After
          a chase, a cheetah needs half an hour to catch its breath before it
          can eat. Common Name: Cheetahs.
