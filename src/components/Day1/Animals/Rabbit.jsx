        <p>
          Rabbits are small, furry mammals with long ears, short fluffy tails,
          and strong, large hind legs. They have 2 pairs of sharp incisors
          (front teeth), one pair on top and one pair on the bottom. They also
          have 2 peg teeth behind the top incisors. Their teeth are specifically
          adapted for gnawing and grow continuously throughout their lives.
